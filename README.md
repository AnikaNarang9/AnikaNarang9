I'm a college student who lives in India. I'm learning Web Development and improving my coding skills currently. I love making and designing webpages with Bootstrap and JavaScript. It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily see. I also enjoy programming in C++ because it challenges me more. I love it when I can finally solve a difficult problem.

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating a social-media site.
- 🏆 I recently built two games using JavaScript coming soon!!
- 😀 I like to code, read, and draw in my free time.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My first line of code was not "Hello World!"
